# InsurancePrediction

In this project, we analyzed a medical cost personal dataset containing information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and medical charges. We performed various data analysis techniques and explored the data distribution, correlation between different features, and feature importance using different visualization tools.

We also generated multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regression to predict the medical charges. After evaluating the performance of all models using cross-validation, we found that the Random Forest Regression model provided the best results in terms of accuracy.

Overall, these evaluation metrics suggest that the Random Forest Regressor model has performed well in predicting the medical charges based on the provided dataset. Also we plotted a visual interpretation of the most important features in the dataset for predicting medical charges and it is found that smoker_yes is the most important feature in the dataset.

In conclusion, we can say that the Random Forest Regression model can effectively predict the medical charges based on the given dataset. However, further exploration and analysis can be done to improve the performance of the model and to gain more insights into the dataset.
